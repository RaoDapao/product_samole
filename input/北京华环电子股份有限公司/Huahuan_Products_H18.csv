Item,Descriptions
VLAN,"IEEE 802.1Q , IEEE802.1ad"
STP/RSTP/MSTP,"Point to point mode,  implements seconds level link protection switching to ensure highly reliable network quality"
Link aggregation,"3 load sharing algorithms: S-MAC, D-MAC, S-MAC+D-MAC  ,  up to 14 aggregation groups"
Loopback detection,"O  vercome  the influence of loops on network and improve the self-checking, fault tolerance, and robustness of network."
QoS,"Port limited speed, port mirroring, priority trust, flow class, flow policy, priority mapping, queue scheduling"
Interface protection,I  mplement  isolation of layer 2 and layer 3 data between interfaces in the interface protection group  .
Flow control,coordinate two interfaces for normal transmission
DDM,"Monitor  optical port connection status and quality and the intelligent optical module’s emission optical power, reception optical power, temperature, work voltage, laser offset current, and other parameters."
EFM,"Complies with IEEE 802.3ah protocol  ,  a link-level Ethernet OAM technology  ,  focuses on link between two directly connected devices and provides link connectivity check, link fault monitoring, remote fault notification, and other functions."
CFM,Conduct  active fault diagnosis for EVC (Ethernet Virtual Connection) and reduce network maintenance cost  .
SLA,"Collect  statistics of response time, n  etwork jitter, delay, packet loss rate, and other network information  ,  monitor the related measures by selecting different jobs for different applications  ."
LLDP,"Based on IEEE 802.1ab  ,  NMS can quickly master topology and changing conditions of layer-2 network."
MAC address forwarding control,supports up to  16K MAC address table entries
ACL,"B  ased  on port  , includes IP ACL and MAC ACL."
Strom suppression,"The upper limit of bandwidth is 50Mbps  ,  supports limi  ting bandwidth of  three kinds of broadcast flow  :  Unknown unicast flow  ,  Unknown multicast flow  ,  Broadcast flow  ."
LFP,"Link Fault Pass,  avoid flow loss when uplink fault cannot be sensed by the lower layer devices."
RMON,"Remote Network Monitoring  ,  realizes functions of statistics and alarm  ,  monitor the remote device more actively and effectively than SNMP, making network administrators can track failures occurring to the network, segment and device more quickly."
DHCP,"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol  ,  client/server model  ,  realize dynamic configuration of things like IP address."
NTP,"Network Time Protocol  ,  a time synchronization protocol defined by RFC1305, used for the time synchronization between distributed time server and client  ."
