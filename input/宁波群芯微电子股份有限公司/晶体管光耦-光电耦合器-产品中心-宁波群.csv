|光电耦合器|无|Optocouplers are devices that use light as a medium to transmit electrical signals. Generally, light emitters and light receivers are packaged in the same shell. When an electrical signal is applied to the input end, the light emitter emits light, and the light receiver receives light and generates a photoelectric current, which flows out of the output end, thus realizing the "electricity light electricity" control|
