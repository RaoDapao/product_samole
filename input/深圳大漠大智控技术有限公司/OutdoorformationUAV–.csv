In 2022, Light up display drones are now a huge part of big events, and the good news is we have just launched our light up drones to the market. The manufacturing company DAMODA, has ensured that these launched light up display drones are capable of scintillating performances and display actions, and are worthy of completing their tasks. This is possible by the amazing features our light up drones possess. Our light up display drones has built-in RGBW (Red, Blue, Green, and White) LEDs to display colors using additive color mixing. Both have a maximum luminous flux of 1440 I’m, this enables them to display bright colors even from long distances. Each drone has a range of 12-18 minutes of showtime and 18-26 minutes of Hover time which results in sustainable effective display and exhibition. No more worries about losing connection when reaching long distances, because our light up display drones have been equipped with Long-distance Wi-Fi to fly more than 500 meters and still retain clear communication. They can fly as far as 1000 m with the connection still intact. Adjustable speed control is added; up to 8 levels to fly at the needed speed for displaying an image or pattern.
