|GRYPHON LRF|GH25L|All-in-one design meets the needs of all-day & all-weather observation. Outstanding Image Algorithm. Self-developed image algorithm optimizes image quality, bringing users a high-definition and cleaner picture, highlighting the edge of the object. Advanced Technology. 1. New Way to Control. The wheel is used for menu selection and zooming, making the operation more natural. Each rotation delivers an excellent sense of control to users. 2. Advanced VOx 12µm Imaging Sensor. The powerful VOx 12µm imaging sensor with NETD<35mK ensure the perfect distinction of the target and present clear and detailed pictures even in complete darkness. 3. Built-in Laser Rangefinder, Accurately Measure the Distance. The integrated laser rangefinder allows to determine the distance in various scenarios, which plays an important role in precision shooting. 4. Replaceable Battery. Two batteries and a HIKMICRO external battery charger are included in the package box, which gives the freedom to observe as long as needed even a full day.|
