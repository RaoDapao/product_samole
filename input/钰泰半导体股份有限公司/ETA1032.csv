DESCRIPTION,FEATURES
"ETA1032 is highly efficient 2.5 MHz, 1.5A input current, step-up DC-to-DC converters. ETA1032 convert input voltages from 2.5 V to 5.25 V to a fixed output voltage of 5V.  Unlike most step-up converter, it incorporates circuits that disconnect the input from output, during shutdown, short-circuit, output current overloading, or other events when output is higher than the input. This eliminates the need for an external MOSFET and its control circuitry to disconnect the input from output, and provides robust output overload protection. These devices are optimized for battery-powered applications. High efficiency of up to 95% enables an extended battery life in all portable designs. Step-up operation at a switching frequency 2.5 MHz allows using 1uH inductor and 10uF output capacitor.  ETA1032 is available in a CSP1.2×1.2-9 package.",w Up to 95% DC-DC Efficiency  w Up to 1. 5A Max input current  w Output Disconnect  w Short-circuit Protection  w Output to Input Reversed Current Protection  w 45μA No load IQ and light load PFM Mode; BYPASS MODE  w Current Mode control  w Logic Control Shutdown and Thermal shutdown  w Fixed 5V Output Voltage  w CSP1.2×1.2-9 package
